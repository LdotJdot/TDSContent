# TDSContent: Ultra-Fast File Full-Text Search
  
## Introduction
`TDSContent` (version c1.0.5) is a powerful, open-source file content search tool designed to deliver lightning-fast search results in milliseconds. Built with `C#` based on `Lucene` engine and featuring a sleek interface crafted using `Avalonia`, TDSContent stands out from traditional full-disk indexing tools by offering targeted and efficient searching capabilities. It is the sister project of the `TDS` file name search tool (https://github.com/LdotJdot/TDS), complementing its functionality by addressing the need for file content search.

Unlike traditional tools that index entire disks, TDSContent allows users to specify particular folder directories and select specific file extensions.
